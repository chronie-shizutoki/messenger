  "version.update_content": "We're delighted to announce the addition of dark mode to enhance your messaging experience! You can now enjoy chatting comfortably in low-light settings with our brand-new dark mode feature.\n\nDark mode has been meticulously crafted with a dedicated stylesheet, dark.css, which offers improved contrast and readability throughout the app. Whether you're messaging late at night or simply prefer a darker interface, this update ensures you won't strain your eyes while keeping in touch with friends and family.\n\nOur development team has optimised the colours of all major UI elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing dark theme. Scrollbars are now easier to see and use, and modals stand out clearly against the dark background. Input fields have been adjusted for better visibility, so you can type your messages without any hassle.\n\nMessages themselves have also received special attention. The text colours and background combinations have been fine-tuned to ensure your conversations are always easy to read. That means no more squinting or adjusting your screen brightness when you're in a dimly lit room.\n\nTo switch to dark mode, simply go to the app's settings and look for the dark mode option. We believe this new feature will make your time on Messenger even more enjoyable, regardless of the lighting conditions. Give it a try and let us know your thoughts!",
